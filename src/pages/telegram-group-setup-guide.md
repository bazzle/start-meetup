# Telegram Group Setup Guide

1. Make your Telegram group public and then change the URL to something that matches your group name and is human readable. 
2. Search for Shieldy and add it to the group.
3. Make Shieldy an admin. 
4. Prevent anyone except admins from interacting with Shieldy with the `/lock` command.
5. The rest of the setup is up to your personal preference, but here are some recommendations. 
	1. Set a custom greeting with /greeting
	2. Type `/deleteGreetingTime 100` to remove greeeting messages for new users after 100 seconds. 
	3. /captcha and choose digits.


To save time you can copy/paste the following text to setup Shieldy in one message -

  
/setConfig <br />
language: en <br />
captchaType: digits <br />
timeGiven: 240 <br />
adminLocked: true <br />
restrict: false <br />
noChannelLinks: false <br />
deleteEntryMessages: false <br />
greetsUsers: true <br />
customCaptchaMessage: false <br />
strict: true <br />
deleteGreetingTime: 120 <br />
banUsers: false <br />
deleteEntryOnKick: true <br />
cas: true <br />
underAttack: false <br />
noAttack: false <br />
buttonText: Not set <br />
allowInvitingBots: false <br />
skipOldUsers: false <br />
skipVerifiedUsers: false <br />
restrictTime: 24 <br />
banNewTelegramUsers: false <br />

Note - Shieldy needs to be an admin to display welcome messages.

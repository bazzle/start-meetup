# How to start a Bitcoin Meetup

I've been using these steps to help setup Bitcoin meetups all over the UK and Ireland for the past 2 years. To help simplify the process and remove myself as a bottleneck, I’ve laid out the steps and principles below. 

1. Think of a name for the group. eg Liverpool Bitcoiners. 
2. Create a logo for the group. This can be super simple or contact us for help with a design. (We have members of the team that can whip something up with photoshop)
3. Steps 4-6 are optional, but you must provide at least one way for potential new members to contact the meetup in order to be listed on [https://bitcoinevents.uk](https://bitcoinevents.uk).
4. Create a Twitter account for the group.
5. Create a Nostr account for the group.
6. Create a Telegram group. (Follow [these steps](/telegram-group-setup-guide/) to get the Telegram group setup)
7. Find a local venue that seems suitable. This could be a pub (most popular), cafe, co-working space etc. It doesn’t have to be somewhere that accepts bitcoin as payment, but if you have somewhere nearby definitely use that. Check-out [this map](https://bitcoinevents.uk/spending/) to see what bitcoin accepting businesses are near you. Read more about the importance of Bitcoin meetups and Merchant adoption here.
9. Announce the details for your first meetup on your new Twitter/X and Nostr accounts and also in your Telegram group. 
10. Fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/Ng5g5AE32kd23Uum8) to give us all the details so that we can list your newly minted meetup on https://bitcoinevents.uk.
11. We will then list and promote your meetup and give you access to some other useful resources.

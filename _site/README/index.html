<h1>How to start a Bitcoin Meetup</h1>
<p>I've been using these steps to help setup Bitcoin meetups all over the UK and Ireland for the past 2 years. To help simplify the process and remove myself as a bottleneck, I’ve laid out the steps and principles below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of a name for the group. eg Liverpool Bitcoiners.</li>
<li>Create a logo for the group. This can be super simple or contact us for help with a design. (We have members of the team that can whip something up with photoshop)</li>
<li>Steps 4-6 are optional, but you must provide at least one way for potential new members to contact the meetup in order to be listed on https://bitcoinevents.uk.</li>
<li>Create a Twitter account for the group.</li>
<li>Create a Nostr account for the group.</li>
<li>Create a Telegram group. (Follow <a href="TelegramGroupSetup.md">these steps</a> to get the Telegram group setup)</li>
<li>Find a local venue that seems suitable. This could be a pub (most popular), cafe, co-working space etc. It doesn’t have to be somewhere that accepts bitcoin as payment, but if you have somewhere nearby definitely use that. Check-out <a href="https://bitcoinevents.uk/spending/">this map</a> to see what bitcoin accepting businesses are near you.

<li>Announce the details for your first meetup on your new Twitter/X and Nostr accounts and also in your Telegram group.</li>
<li>Fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/Ng5g5AE32kd23Uum8">this form</a> to give us all the details so that we can list your newly minted meetup on https://bitcoinevents.uk.</li>
<li>We will then list and promote your meetup and give you access to some other useful resources.</li>
</ol>
